An animated programming aid for teacher presentation and use in a computer lab. Initially implemented for teaching python to beginners. Uses turtles to animate the  presentation. Written in  Python 3.
Enables teachers to present python programs as well as slides. The programs can be segmented and stopped and started with a clicker, or downpage key, as in standard powerpoint.
There is no front-end selection as to what goes in. A function name is required, with a '#' mark to blank it, in the list of functions and slides to be presented.
